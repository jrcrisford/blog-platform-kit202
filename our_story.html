                    <p>
                        Our site theme is called <strong>"Everything Explained"</strong>.
                        It’s designed to be a flexible and user-friendly blog where users can post 
                        about any topic of interest—no matter how random or niche.
                        The design focuses on clarity, readability, and modern aesthetics using a 
                        glassmorphism style.
                        Features like dark mode, responsive navigation, and collapsible post sections 
                        enhance the usability and interactivity of the site across devices.

                        <li><strong>Glassmorphism Design</strong> – Modern visual style with layered backgrounds, blur effects, and soft shadows for a sleek, polished aesthetic.</li>

                        <p>
                            Started by creating the initial project setup. This included creating the project folder structure 
                            (html, css, js) and added all the required HTML files with names relevant to the pages they related 
                            too and the basic HTML boilerplate. Created an empty shared stylesheet and linked JavaScript files 
                            for each page that sounded like it might require them.<br>
                            Built out index.html with a semantic structure that included a header which included navigation, 
                            however I'm unsure if this should be within the header or as a separate element, three complete 
                            placeholder blog posts, and a footer. Each of the posts contains a title, metadata (name, date), 
                            tags, and content of 150 words each.

                            I began the <code>older.html</code> file. Initially one blog post was set up with the same layout as 
                            the ones in <code>index.html</code> but also included a toggle button to reveal or hide its content 
                            using the <code>older.js</code> script. The toggle worked by placing a &lt;button&gt; element above 
                            a hidden &lt;div&gt; containing the content and using JavaScript to detect the button click and switch 
                            the ‘hidden’ class on the next sibling element. Figuring out how to locate the element to toggle and 
                            assign it to a variable involved a bit of research — I found that the <code>.nextElementSibling</code> 
                            property was suitable.<br>
                            During testing, I couldn’t get the JavaScript to run. I later figured out that the script path was 
                            incorrect, and the CSS path also had typos. Because the JS file was stored in a folder outside the one 
                            with the HTML file, I needed to change the &lt;script&gt; tag to use a relative path 
                            (<code>../js/older.js</code> rather than <code>js/older.js</code>) — which, in retrospect, makes sense.

                        <p>
                            Completed the <code>write.html</code> page, included all required form fields (title, tags, content), 
                            plus the header, navigation, and footer. Added JavaScript validation rules in 
                            <code>write.js</code> to ensure no fields can be left empty and that the title doesn’t exceed 80 characters.
                            I also improved visual feedback by using <code>reportValidity()</code> to show browser error messages and 
                            added red borders around relevant fields. Initially, there were issues clearing the error styling on resubmission, 
                            but these were resolved by resetting the validation state within the event listener.
                            Console logs were added throughout for debugging — confirming script load, when validation begins, and why 
                            a submission fails. Logs were also added to the completed <code>older.js</code> for consistency.

                            Made improvements to the write post form validation. Before, a single error would display at a time —
                            a limitation of using <code>reportValidity()</code>. This meant the validation was likely not to the
                            assignment spec, so the logic was changed to check all fields and show relevant error messages simultaneously.
                            <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements for each input were added to display these messages, and they were styled
                            using CSS to ensure visual feedback for the user.

                            The form is integrated with JavaScript for input validation. While testing, I noticed some classes and IDs were
                            incorrectly set up, which affected the styling and functionality. I'll fix these issues to ensure everything

                            Today I refactored <code>write.js</code> and renamed it to <code>validation.js</code> so it could act as a single
                            script handling form validation across multiple pages on the site. The logic was restructured into a reusable format
                            using arrays and loops, making it easier to validate different forms. I also completed the validation rules for both
                            the login and register pages, including password confirmation and email format checks. These changes improve input
                            consistency and reduce future maintenance.

                            I added styling to match the rest of the site. Adjustments were made to the error messages to make 
                            them clearer and more consistent across pages. I then made sure that my devlog entries were added to 
                            the our story page and included the collapsible post format like the older posts page and I corrected 
                            some small issues in layout and formatting.

                            The main goal was to enhance the layout using CSS to achieve the best possible look. The challenge, 
                            however, was deciding which style to go with. After watching numerous videos on both glassmorphism and 
                            neumorphism, I found myself particularly drawn to both styles. Ultimately, the decision was clear, and 
                            I decided to start with a glassmorphism-inspired design. As the project progressed, I continued to refine 
                            and build upon this aesthetic, ultimately completing the entire design using the same glassmorphism style.

                            added his own unique touch to the site. However, I felt there was still more that could be done, so I 
                            sought inspiration from various YouTube videos and websites. With these ideas in mind, I refined the 
                            design, incorporating gradients, smooth transitions, transformations, and other components to give the 
                            site a sleek and elegant look. The result is a website that feels both modern and polished.

                            Today I addressed the feedback given for Assignment 1 to improve the frontend before starting backend integration.

                                <li>Locked the width of the textarea in the Write Post page to prevent resizing layout issues.</li>
                                <li>Added a reset handler to the validation JavaScript to clear validation error messages and input styling on form clear.</li>
                                <li>Enforced a username length constraint (3–20 characters) on the registration form.</li>
                                <li>Restyled the [Show Content] button on the Older Posts page to reduce the visual dominance on the button.</li>
                                <li>Removed the hover layout shift on blog post cards by eliminating the transform animation and fixing shadow transitions.</li>

                            Today I completed the full database design and implementation for the blog, laying the foundation for the backend functionality to follow.
                            This included designing the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using Crow’s Foot notation with all the required entities, plus additional ones to support HD-level features: users, posts, tags, comments, and ratings.
                            I ensured all relationships and constraints were clearly defined where appropriate. An in-depth data dictionary was also created to outline the structure of each table, including rules and example data values.

                        <p>
                            With the design finalised, I implemented the schema in phpMyAdmin using SQL <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements (I prefer writing raw SQL rather than using the GUI), and inserted test data across all tables to prepare for backend development.
                            This confirmed that the database worked as intended and according to the designed schema, and was ready to support dynamic content through PHP.

                            Today I implemented the login and registration systems using PHP and connected them to the database.
                            The <code>register.php</code> script accepts input from the registration form, checks for issues like duplicate usernames or emails, hashes the password, and stores the new user in the database with the default role of “member”.
                            The <code>login.php</code> script retrieves the user by their username, verifies the password using <code>password_verify()</code>, stores the relevant user information in PHP session variables, and redirects to the (soon-to-be-built) PHP version of the homepage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I encountered a major issue during development caused by the browser caching an older version of <code>validation.js</code>.
                            Despite updating the JavaScript file on the web server, the browser continued executing the outdated version, which redirected users to <code>index.html</code> and bypassed the backend PHP scripts entirely.
                            The issue was resolved by appending <code>?v=3</code> to the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in each HTML file using the validation script.
                            A very simple fix for a problem that took hours to track down!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To simplify future development, I also created a shared <code>db_connect.php</code> file that handles the database connection.
                            This file can now be included in any PHP script using <code>require_once</code>, removing the need to repeat connection logic in every file.
